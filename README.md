## Test Execution Reports

Reports are generated automatically in the `playwright-report/` folder after test execution. Use `npx playwright show-report` to open them in a browser.

Sample log output:

```
Running 5 tests using 1 worker
  âœ” Sorting Tests âœ” Verify Z-A Sorting (Chromium)
  âœ” Sorting Tests âœ” Verify Price High-Low Sorting (Chromium)
  âœ” Cart Tests âœ” Add multiple items and checkout (Chromium)
  âœ” Accessibility Tests âœ” Accessibility check on All Items page (Chromium)

All tests passed! ðŸŽ‰
```

## Notes

- Only **Chromium** browser is used for testing.
- Make sure to have a stable internet connection for SauceDemo site access.
- For accessibility testing, `@axe-core/playwright` is used.

Happy Testing! ðŸš€
